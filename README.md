### [Pig Game by Paul Kelvin](https://piggamebypaulkelvin.netlify.app/)
#### Description
A simple dice game called Piggame pits two players against one another to roll dice until they reach a certain score. Several computer programming ideas are utilized in the game:
* Variables: The game keeps track of the current and total scores for each player using variables.
* Randomization: The game uses randomization to simulate the roll of dice.
* Conditional statements: The game checks if a player rolls a 1 and switches to the other player if they do. It also checks if a player reaches the target score and declares them as the winner.
* DOM manipulation: The game updates the scores and UI based on the player's actions and game state using DOM manipulation.
* Event handling: The game handles user events such as rolling the dice and starting a new game using event listeners.
