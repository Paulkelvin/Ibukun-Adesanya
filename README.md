Hi, I’m @Paulkelvin, I'm new to coding/programming and,
I’m interested in shaperning my skills in web development
I currently concluded a course on CSS and i think my skill is a bit well to do on that. Now, I am proceeding to Javascript and I need the right orientation.
I’m looking to collaborate with teams on the entire web development facet of programming/coding
