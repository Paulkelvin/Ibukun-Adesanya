I'm a software engineer with a keen interest of solving hand-operated problems. I specialize in JavaScript, React, C, and Python and love working with tools and technologies such as git & GitHub, unix shell scripting, IDEs..

## Projects 📂

Here are some projects I've worked on recently using JavaScript:

### [Geo-Logic](https://github.com/Paulkelvin/Geo-Logic)
#### Description
* 🔬 This mobile-responsive application automates geometric computations in real time, replacing the need for time-consuming manual calculations. With Geo-Logic, you can easily input your geodata and receive immediate answers for calculations like bearing, distance, delta & Y, and the coordinates of successive sites. 📐
* It is customizable; it allows the dynamic addition and removal of rows, and also clearing of tabledata.
#### Tools
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### [Enzoe](https://enzoe.netlify.app/)
#### Description
* This is a portfolio website showcasing Ifeoluwa Daniel's course of life using excellent HTML structure, semantics and good use of colors.
#### Tools
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### [Online Distance Bearing Calculator](https://online-distance-bearing-calculator.netlify.app/)
#### Description
* This is a calculator that solves a geoinformatic problem. It takes the coordinates of two points and calculates the distance and bearing between them.
* It is useful for navigation and data gathering.
#### Tools
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### [Pig Game by Paul Kelvin](https://piggamebypaulkelvin.netlify.app/)
#### Description
A simple dice game called Piggame pits two players against one another to roll dice until they reach a certain score. Several computer programming ideas are utilized in the game:
* Variables: The game keeps track of the current and total scores for each player using variables.
* Randomization: The game uses randomization to simulate the roll of dice.
* Conditional statements: The game checks if a player rolls a 1 and switches to the other player if they do. It also checks if a player reaches the target score and declares them as the winner.
* DOM manipulation: The game updates the scores and UI based on the player's actions and game state using DOM manipulation.
* Event handling: The game handles user events such as rolling the dice and starting a new game using event listeners.
#### Tools
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
