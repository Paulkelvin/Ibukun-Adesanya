<p>Hi, I’m Paulkelvin, and I'm new to coding/programming</h1>, about 3 months old.
I’m interested in shapening my skills in web development.
I just concluded a course on CSS and i think my skill is a bit well to do on that. Now, I am proceeding to Javascript and I need the right orientation.
I’m looking to collaborate with well versed developers on the entire web development facet of programming/coding or firms willing to recruit personals for intership.
kindly contact me by sending a message to this <em><a href="mailto:ibukunadesanya0@gmail.com">email address</a><em> or call me on <a href="Tel:+2348169826503>this number<a>, thanks</p>
